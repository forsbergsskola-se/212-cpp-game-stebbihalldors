<h1>Cookie Clicker Project:</h1> <br>

**Project**: <br>
Make a simple c++ game in SDL Framework. 

**Cookie Clicker** <br>
-you click on a button <br>
-you get a cookie <br>
-for n cookies you can buy a cookie producer <br>
-the cookie producer produces cookies in regular intervals <br>
-for n cookies you can buy upgrades for producer <br>
-the cookie producer produces more cookies in regular interval <br>

**Design Pattern** <br>
Using Sequencing Pattern: Update Method. <br>
Using Observer Pattern(soon) <br>

**SDL** <br>
-LazyFoo tutorial was used: https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php <br>
-Refactor for c++ standard oop <br>
-Inhertence, polymorphism, unique_ptrs, vectors <br>

**Take aways** <br>
Learned alot from this assignment with SDl and c++, how to use Design Patterns and Split up responsibilities in classes. <br>
Still needs alot more work to refactor and fix few things like: <br>
-Need to add more unique_ptr or delete manually where dynamically alloceded (memory leak atm) <br>
-Split up the TTF Font into its seperate class instead of handle it in main. <br>
-Setup the Observer Pattern <br>
-Add +1 font image when clicking the cookie on mouse pointer <br>
-Add Image of CookieProducer and when it produces show as above <br>
-Make use of advanced C++ Features such as <vr>
-runtime polymorphism <br>
-compile-time polymorphism <br>
-concepts <br>
-function pointers <br>
-collections <br>
